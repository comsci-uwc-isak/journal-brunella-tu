Today we learned how to use the terminal in the Mac. I was wondering why would this
be useful, or where in the curriculum it was: this will be useful when connecting one
of our programs to a Mac. Overall, I thought the learning process was interesting and
the skills I acquired today were some I think will be useful in the future.
