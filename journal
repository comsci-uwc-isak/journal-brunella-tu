Today we learned how to use the terminal in the Mac. I was wondering why would this
be useful, or where in the curriculum it was: this will be useful when connecting one
of our programs to a Mac. Overall, I thought the learning process was interesting and
the skills I acquired today were some I think will be useful in the future.

Today we used the terminal to access a Raspberry Pi. It was confusing for me -- it is still
difficult to wrap my head around the concept of the terminal. It feels very abstract. Though
I was not able to finish the task, I still enjoyed trying to write a program that worked as 
a menu in the Raspberry Pi. I learned a bit more about Bash and how to use it -- I actually
learn much more by working on a problem myself than by watching someone solve it. 

I think I will have to do some work outside of class to make sure that what we learned today
stays with me.
