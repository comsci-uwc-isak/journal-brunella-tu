Today we learned how to use the terminal in the Mac. I was wondering why would this be 
useful, or where in the curriculum it was: this will be useful when connecting one of our 
programs to a Mac. Overall, I thought the learning process was interesting and the skills I
acquired today were some I think will be useful in the future.

Today we used the terminal to access a Raspberry Pi. It was confusing for me -- it is still
difficult to wrap my head around the concept of the terminal. It feels very abstract. Though
I was not able to finish the task, I still enjoyed trying to write a program that worked as 
a menu in the Raspberry Pi. I learned a bit more about Bash and how to use it -- I actually
learn much more by working on a problem myself than by watching someone solve it. 

I think I will have to do some work outside of class to make sure that what we learned today
stays with me.

Today we set up a tiny webpage in a server using Raspberry Pi. We used pug, a language that 
makes writing in html much easier, to control how the website looked. We reviewed a bit of 
the material we covered yesterday (how to access Pi, etc).  I can see myself using this
lesson when doing the web design for my CAS project. 

I think my grasp of the concepts is much stronger when I work towards projects, even if
these are as tiny as writing simple html for a webpage. I'll be allocating some time later
today to reviewing what we learned today and learning more about styling.
